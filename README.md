## Anarchoverse: From Fiction and Games to Revolution

Asymmetric cryptography and the Internet are perhaps the most important inventions to realize the Anarchic Revolution. 

Yet, when Karl Marx penned the Communist Manifesto, it was a work of fiction, until it became a revolution. 

Anarchoverse is the name of a computer game that simulates the Anarchic Revolution, except that we do not know if the programs in Anarchoverse may one day connect themselves to the real world.
