## Anarchoverse: From Fiction and Games to Revolution

Asymmetric cryptography and the Internet are perhaps the most important inventions to realize the Anarchic Revolution. 

Yet, when Karl Marx penned the Communist Manifesto, it was a work of fiction, until it became a revolution. 

Anarchoverse is the name of a computer game that simulates the Anarchic Revolution, except that we do not know if the programs in Anarchoverse may one day connect themselves to the real world.

The "killer app" in Anarchoverse is the AnarchoToken, a simple yet revolutionary asymetric cryptographic scheme to realize borderless micropayments and decentralized messaging. 

While asymetric cryptography has become the foundations of numerous revolutionary technologies, from TLS to Bitcoin, its most radical use case takes a much simpler form:

We use the names DatongToken and AnarchoToken interchangeably, for different audiences. In terms of implementation, the name Anarchoverse captures the imagination much better, so that we can recruit as many collaborators as possible, as soon as possible.

The core engine of AnarchoToken is based on the "stack machine shell" -- also a simple yet revolutionary piece of work:

The basic idea is that AnarchoToken can be executed in computer games (mobile or desktop), allowing users to send "money" (definitons later!!), realizing "borderless micropayments".

Readers may wonder in the age of a thousand and one cryptocurrencies, who needs "borderless micropayments"?

The answer lies in "adoption". Any cryptocurrency system to date requires registration and login. AnarchoToken is basically a system of authentication that DOES NOT require registration, thus overcome the biggest obstacle of all crytocurrency systems.

Not only does AnarchoToken works with cryptocurrencies, it also works all national currencies and online banking systems as well.

Again some readers may ask: If AnarchoToken is so wonderful, why has it not been conceived and implemented earlier?

The answer is again simple and revolutionary: it may destroy the existing global financial system (read US Dollar) in the snap of a finger (Thanos style)!!

How is that possible? How is such a simple idea able to destroy the global financial system?

Let's remind ourselves that we are discussing the technicalities of AnarchoToken in the context of Anarchoverse -- a work of fiction and computer game.
