## Anarchoverse: From Fiction and Games to Revolution

Asymmetric cryptography and the Internet are perhaps the most important inventions to realize the Anarchic Revolution. 

Yet, when Karl Marx penned the Communist Manifesto, it was a work of fiction, until it became a revolution. 

Anarchoverse is the name of a computer game that simulates the Anarchic Revolution, except that we do not know if the programs in Anarchoverse may one day connect themselves to the real world.

The "killer app" in Anarchoverse is the AnarchoToken, a simple yet revolutionary asymetric cryptographic scheme to realize borderless micropayments and decentralized messaging. 

While asymetric cryptography has become the foundations of numerous revolutionary technologies, from TLS to Bitcoin, its most radical use case takes a much simpler form:

We use the names DatongToken and AnarchoToken interchangeably, for different audiences. In terms of implementation, the name Anarchoverse captures the imagination much better, so that we can recruit as many collaborators as possible, as soon as possible.

The core engine of AnarchoToken is based on the "stack machine shell" -- also a simple yet revolutionary piece of work:
