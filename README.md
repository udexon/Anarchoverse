## Anarchoverse: From Fiction and Games to Revolution

Asymmetric cryptography and the Internet are perhaps the most important inventions to realize the Anarchic Revolution. 

Yet, when Karl Marx penned the Communist Manifesto, it was a work of fiction, until it became a revolution. 

Anarchoverse is the name of a computer game that simulates the Anarchic Revolution, except that we do not know if the programs in Anarchoverse may one day connect themselves to the real world.

The "killer app" in Anarchoverse is the AnarchoToken, a simple yet revolutionary asymetric cryptographic scheme to realize borderless micropayments and decentralized messaging. 

While asymetric cryptography has become the foundations of numerous revolutionary technologies, from TLS to Bitcoin, its most radical use case takes a much simpler form:

We use the names DatongToken and AnarchoToken interchangeably, for different audiences. In terms of implementation, the name Anarchoverse captures the imagination much better, so that we can recruit as many collaborators as possible, as soon as possible.

The core engine of AnarchoToken is based on the "stack machine shell" -- also a simple yet revolutionary piece of work:

The basic idea is that AnarchoToken can be executed in computer games (mobile or desktop), allowing users to send "money" (definitons later!!), realizing "borderless micropayments".

Readers may wonder in the age of a thousand and one cryptocurrencies, who needs "borderless micropayments"?

The answer lies in "adoption". Any cryptocurrency system to date requires registration and login. AnarchoToken is basically a system of authentication that DOES NOT require registration, thus overcome the biggest obstacle of all crytocurrency systems.

Not only does AnarchoToken works with cryptocurrencies, it also works all national currencies and online banking systems as well.

Again some readers may ask: If AnarchoToken is so wonderful, why has it not been conceived and implemented earlier?

The answer is again simple and revolutionary: it may destroy the existing global financial system (read US Dollar) in the snap of a finger (Thanos style)!!

How is that possible? How is such a simple idea able to destroy the global financial system?

Let's remind ourselves that we are discussing the technicalities of AnarchoToken in the context of Anarchoverse -- a work of fiction and computer game.



Let's call the network for transmitting payments and messages using AnarchoToken Anarchonet. We may liken the conventional banking system to the old analogue telephone network, and Anarchonet to Internet.

In conventional banking system, in its most basic form, a sender can send money to the Recipient if and only if they have accounts in the same bank. If they have accounts on different banks, their banks would need to connected via payment gateways like Swift. 

In Anarchonet, any individual person can act as a payment gateway (Anarcho Agent), connecting to accounts of different banks. 

What is the barrier of entry for anyone to become an Anarcho Agent? Refer to traditional Hawala. Modern technology concentrate lots of technical advancement to make it possible ....

The short answer is: Most users would have at least one bank account in the modern world, but the chances of the sender and recipient to have accounts in the same bank would be much lower. In such cases, we need a chain of Anarcho Agents who can act as payment gateways (much like Internet router) to connect the bank of the sender to the bank of the recipient. The only other missing ingredient is a system to autheticate the identities of the sender, recipient and the Anarcho Agents, which asymmetric crytography can provide.

Although conventional commercial money transfer services like Western Union play the role of the payment gateway, their commission fees are quite hefty. With Anarchonet, Anarcho Agents will compete with each other to reach the lowest fees.

The advent of social networks has created the phenomena of Internet stars will millions of followers, with thousands of likes on videos or photos posted on a daily basis. It urgently needs a solution like Anarchonet to monetize these activities optimally. Although Facebook has launched its own cryptocurrency Libra recently, Anarchonet is much more superior, perhaps the final form of evolution in payment gateways. At the probability of 1 in 1000 users tipping USD 1 per day, based on 100 million users (a very conservative measure), that would be USD 100K of tips daily.
